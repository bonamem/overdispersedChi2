M. Bonamente 2023

This code implements the convolution (Eq. 27 in Bonamente 2023) of
a chi^2(nu) distribution with a zero-mean Gaussian N(0,sigma^2) representing the
overdispersed chi^2 distribution. 
The code also reproduces Table 1 of the paper, and it can be extended to
calculate any critical value of the distribution.
